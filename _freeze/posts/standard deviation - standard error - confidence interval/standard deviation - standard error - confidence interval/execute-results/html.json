Conversely, a larger standard error suggests that the sample statistic has more uncertainty and could vary widely in different samples.\n\n## Confidence interval\n\nA confidence interval is a statistical range that is constructed around a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, to estimate the likely range of values of the corresponding population parameter. It provides a measure of uncertainty about the true value of the population parameter based on the information available from a sample.\n\n-   A confidence interval is a range of values around a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) to estimate the likely range of values of the corresponding population parameter.\n-   It provides a measure of the uncertainty about the true value the population parameter.\n-   The confidence level is typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95% confidence interval), and it represents the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter in repeated sampling.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval (denoted as $CI$) is:\n\n$$CI = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n-   $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean\n\n-   $z$ is the confidence level value\n\n-   $s$ is the sample standard deviation\n\n-   $n$ is the sample size (number of data points in the dataset)\n\nConfidence intervals are used in statistical inference as they provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter and help in making more informed decisions and drawing conclusions from sample data.\n\nThe wider the confidence interval, the less precise the estimate, while a narrower confidence interval indicates a more precise estimate.\n\n::: callout-note\n-   The standard deviation quantifies the variation within a single dataset, while standard error quantifies the variability of a sample statistic across different samples from the same population.\n\n-   The standard deviation describes the spread of the data points, while standard error describes the precision of a sample statistic in estimating the population parameter.\n\n-   The standard error is a measure of precision or accuracy of the sample estimate, while a confidence interval is a range of values that provides an estimate of the likely range of the population parameter with a specified level of confidence.\n\n-   The standard error helps in understanding the variability of the sample statistic, while confidence intervals help in making inferences about the population parameter based on the sample data.\n:::\n",
