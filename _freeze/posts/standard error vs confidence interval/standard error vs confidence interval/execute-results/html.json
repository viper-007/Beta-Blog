Confidence intervals are the quantiles of the distribution of the parameter of interest, that you are estimating, at least in a frequentist paradigm.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrandom_normal <- rnorm(n = 10,\n                       mean = 10,\n                       sd = 2)\nm <- lm(random_normal ~ 1)\nsummary(m)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = random_normal ~ 1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.0489 -1.6633  0.6611  0.9910  3.6716 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

But they can be the same, if we'll set confidence interval to 68% level (instead of 95%), we'll get virtually the same answer, as 10.7324 +/-0.7154.\n\nSide note: regressing with syntax `random_normal ~ 1` is the same as estimating the mean. It's just for convenience to quickly obtain standard errors and CI in this particular case. Reporting both won't hurt, to my opinion. But CI's, in general, are more versatile.\n",
