A confidence interval is a statistical concept used to provide an estimate for an unknown parameter in a population. It indicates how certain or trustworthy that estimate is. Confidence intervals are often used in the context of hypothesis testing and estimation in statistics.

In statistics, a confidence interval is usually defined as a range of values within which the true value of a parameter lies with a certain probability. For example, a 95% confidence interval indicates that there is a 95% probability that the true value of the parameter lies within that interval.

The calculation of a confidence interval depends on the underlying statistical model and the distribution of the data. Typically, the standard normal distribution or the t-distribution is used, depending on the size of the sample.

Confidence intervals are useful to account for uncertainty in estimates and to better interpret the results of studies or surveys.

## Parameter estimation

There are two estimation methods in inferential statistics:

-   point estimation

-   interval estimation

### Point estimation

In point estimation, properties about the population are determined as exact values and are usually given a measure of the estimation error.

### Interval estimation

In interval estimation, an interval is specified for the characteristic of the population, and this is then given a confidence interval (e.g., 95%).

### Conclusion

Point estimation pretends "pseudo-accuracy". The estimated parameter value is given with point accuracy, although the true parameter value is very rarely hit exactly.

You can compare a point estimate to trying to hit a fly (the true parameter value) with a pin (point estimate). With a fly swatter (interval), the probability of hitting the fly is much higher.

## Confidence Interval Definition

A confidence interval is a statistical interval that contains the location of a true parameter of a population with a certain probability. A confidence level of 95% contains the true value with 95% probability. However, a confidence level of 95% does not mean that 95% of the data lies within this interval.

![](/posts/confidence%20interval/Konfidenzintervall.png)

The intervals $\hat{\theta}_A$, $\hat{\theta}_B$ and $\hat{\theta}_E$ do not contain the true value $\theta$.

The intervals $\hat{\theta}_A$ and $\hat{\theta}_E$ belong to the 5% of the "least likely" (farthest from the true value) sample values.

A confidence interval has a lower bound $x_u$ and an upper bound $x_o$.

$\bar{x}$ denotes the mean of the data set, $z_u$ and $z_o$ are the z-transformed interval limits.

The standard error is the fraction of the standard deviation $s_x$ and the square root of the sample size $n$.

$$ \begin{equation} \tag{1.0}
    \large x_u = \bar{x} + z_u \cdot \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation} $$

$$ \begin{equation} \tag{1.1}
    \large x_o = \bar{x} + z_o \cdot \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation} $$

## Example

Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the monthly snack spending of a group of people.

**Step 1: Calculate the estimated parameter**

Calculate the mean $\bar{x}$ from the existing data set.

| \# participants | Monthly snack spending USD |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| 20              | 8                          |
| 30              | 32                         |
| 10              | 0                          |
| 30              | 48                         |
| 10              | 16                         |

Sample size $\large n = 20+30+10+30+10 = 100$

$\large \bar{x}=\frac{20\cdot8+30\cdot32+10\cdot0+30\cdot48+10\cdot16}{100}= \text{USD } 27.2$

**Step 2: Transform the interval limits into standard normally distributed values**

With a confidence level of 95%, we obtain the following interval limits: the lower limit is 2.5% $= x_u = 0.025$ and the upper limit is 97.5% $x_o = 0.975$.

We now need to standardize these values by looking at the z-distribution table.

-   For the upper bound $x_o$, the z-value is easy to read: $x_o = 0.975$ corresponds to $z_o = 1.960$.

-   Since the normal distribution is symmetric and mirrored on the x-axis, the lower limit $z_u = -1.960$ results in

![](/posts/confidence%20interval/z-Verteilungstabelle.png)

With a mean of $\bar{x} = 27.20$ USD, a lower limit of $z_u= -1.960$, an upper limit of $z_o= 1.960$ and a sample size of $n = 100$, all required parameters for the formula are given except for the standard deviation $s_x$.

**Step 3: Calculation of variance and standard deviation**

The variance can be calculated using the values from the table as follows:

$\large s_x^2=\ \frac{\left(8-27.2\right)^2\cdot20+\left(32-27.2\right)^2\cdot30+\left(0-27.2\right)^2\cdot10+\left(48-27.2\right)^2\cdot30+\left(16-27.2\right)^2\cdot10}{100}$

$\large s_x^2=296.96$

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

$\large s_x=\sqrt{s_x^2}=\sqrt{296.96}=17.23$

**Step 4: Calculation of lower and upper limit**

$\large x_u=\ \bar{x}+\ z_u\ \cdot\ \frac{s_x}{\sqrt n}=27.2+\left(-1.960\right)\cdot\frac{17.23}{\sqrt{100}}=23.82$

$\large x_o=\ \bar{x}+\ z_o\ \cdot\ \frac{s_x}{\sqrt n}=27.2+1.960\cdot\frac{17.23}{\sqrt{100}}=30.58$

Thus, the limits of the contingency interval are at points 23.82 and 30.58. The conclusion is: with 95% confidence, the true mean for the group of people's monthly snack spending is between USD 23.82 and USDF 30.58.

## Z-Distribution

By performing a z-standardization, we can transform the normal distribution into a standard normal distribution. This can be done with any normal distribution (but only with normal distributions). This gives us a distribution that is always the same, with mean $µ = 0$ and standard deviation $σ = 1$. Just like the normal distribution, the standard normal distribution tells you what percentage of values fall within a given range. Now, this range no longer depends on $µ$ and $σ$, but is standardized.

![](/posts/confidence%20interval/Normal%20Distribution.png)

![](/posts/confidence%20interval/Standard%20Normal%20Distribution.png)

In the standard normal distribution, approximately 68.2% of the values always lie in the range between $z = -1$ and $z = +1$. Or put another way: There is a 68.2% probability that the value is between -1 and +1.

Using a z-transformation or z-standardization, you subtract the arithmetic mean from each measured value, divide the resulting difference by the standard deviation, and you get the so-called *z-scores*.

As formula (with $x$ for the respective value, $μ$ for the arithmetic mean and $σ$ for the standard deviation) $$z=\frac{x-μ}σ$$

After the z-transformation

-   the arithmetic mean of the transformed series is always zero, and

-   the variance and standard deviation are always 1.

If a normal distribution is present, the corresponding probabilities can be read from a standard normal distribution table based on the z-values. The standard normal table contains only positive z-values. Since the normal distribution is symmetric and mirrored on the x-axis, the z-value for the lower limit results from the negative z-value for the upper limit $z_u = -z_o$.

## Three Sigma Rule

The "Three Sigma Rule" is a statistical rule used to quantify the probability of events within a normally distributed data set.

![](/posts/confidence%20interval/Drei-Sigma-Regel.png)

The three sigma rule states that\
a) 68.3% of the data are within one standard deviation of the mean ($\mu \pm \sigma$).

b\) 95.4% of the data are within two standard deviations of the mean ($\mu \pm 2\sigma$).

c\) 99.7% of the data are within 3 standard deviations of the mean ($\mu \pm 3\sigma$).

::: callout-note
The three-sigma rule applies only to normally distributed data sets. The three sigma rule does not apply to skewed triangular distributions.

## R code

**Example 1 -- Confidence interval of dataset**

```{r}
# Calculate confidence interval with function t.test from core package stats

# Sample data
data <- c(23, 28, 32, 27, 25, 30, 31, 29, 26, 24)

# Calculate the confidence interval
# The function t.test performs the Student's t-Tests on vectors of data
# By default conf.level=0.95
result <- t.test(data)

# Extract the confidence interval
confidence_interval <- result$conf.int

# Get the lower bound and the upper bound of the confidence interval
lower_bound <- result$conf.int[1]
upper_bound <- result$conf.int[2]

# Print lower bound and uppder bound of the confidence interval
cat("Lower bound of the 95% confidence interval:", lower_bound, "\n")
cat("Upper bound of the 95% confidence interval:", upper_bound, "\n")

# Plot histogram
plot(data, main = "Histogram", xlab = "Data", ylab = "Value")

# Draw lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval
abline(h = lower_bound, col = 'red', lwd = 1, lty = 2)
text(x = 1.5, y = lower_bound+0.3, labels = "lower bound", col = "#4D4D4D")
abline(h = upper_bound, col = 'red', lwd = 1, lty = 2)
text(x = 1.5, y = upper_bound+0.3, labels = "upper bound", col = "#4D4D4D")
```

The 95% confidence interval is `[25.3, 29.7]`.

**Example 2 -- Univariate Statistic (Median)**

For this example, we will generate $n = 100$ observations from a standard normal distribution, and use the median as the parameter/statistic of interest. Note that the true (population) median is zero. Since the median is a univariate statistic, the bootstrap distribution will be a vector of length $R + 1$ containing the bootstrap replicates of the median.

```{r}
# Univariate Statistic (Median)

library(nptest)

# generate 100 standard normal observations
set.seed(1)
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)

# nonparametric bootstrap
npbs <- np.boot(x = x, statistic = median)
npbs

# check t0, SE, and bias
median(x)                          # t0
sd(npbs$boot.dist)                 # SE
mean(npbs$boot.dist) - npbs$t0     # Bias

# bootstrap distribution
hist(npbs$boot.dist,
     xlab = "t*",
     ylab = "Density",
     main = "Bootstrap Distribution")

# Observed median
abline(v = npbs$t0,
       lty = 2,
       col = "red")

# CI 95% lower boundary
abline(v = npbs$bca[2, 1],
       lty = 2,
       col = "blue")

# CI 95% upper boundary
abline(v = npbs$bca[2, 2],
       lty = 2,
       col = "blue")

legend(
  "topleft",
  legend = c("t0", "CI 95%"),
  col = c("red", "blue"),
  lty = 2,
  bty = "n"
)
```
