The lognormal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that can only take positive values. It describes the distribution of a random variable $X$ if the random variable $Y = ln(X)$ transformed by the logarithm is normally distributed.

The lognormal distribution is often used to model phenomena in which the logarithmized values of the data follow a normal distribution, while the actual data itself has a non-normal distribution.

## Probability Density Function (PDF)

The probability density function of the lognormal distribution is defined by

$$\begin{equation} \tag{1.1} f(x) = \frac{1}{x\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e\left(-\frac{(\ln(x) - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \end{equation}$$

where $x$ is the random variable, $\mu$ is the mean of the logarithmic distribution, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the logarithmic distribution.

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the lognormal distribution is as follows:

$$\begin{equation} \tag{1.2} F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = \Phi (\frac{ln(x)-\mu}{\sigma}) \end{equation}$$

where $\Phi$ denotes the distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

## Relationship between normal and lognormal distribution

If $Y = \mu + \sigma Z$ is normal distributed, then $X\sim e^{Y}$ is lognormal distributed.

## Median

The median of the lognormal distribution is:

$\large x_{med}=e^{\mu}$

The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest.

## Mean

The mean of the lognormal distribution is:

$\large m = e^{\mu + {\frac {\sigma ^{2}}{2}}}$

The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. The mean of the lognormal distribution is equal to the expected value.

## Mode

The mode (the most frequent value of the distribution) of the lognormal distribution is:

$\large Modus(X) = x_{D} = e^{\mu -\sigma ^{2}}$

The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set.

## Expected Value

The expected value of the lognormal distribution is:

$\large E(X) = e^{\mu + {\frac {\sigma ^{2}}{2}}}$

Where $μ$ is the mean value and $σ$ is the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution.

The expected value of a lognormal distribution is a key figure that indicates the central tendency value of the distribution. It is important to note that the expected value of a lognormal distribution is generally greater than the median (the 50th percentile value) of the distribution. This is because the lognormal distribution has a positive skewness (right-skewed), which means that it tends to have higher values.

## Variance

The variance of the lognormal distribution is:

$\large Var(X) = e^{2\mu +\sigma^2} (e^{\sigma^2}-1)$

## Standard deviation

The standard deviation of the lognormal distribution is:

$\large \sqrt Var(X)$

## Skewness

The lognormal distribution is skewed to the right. The greater the difference between the expected value and the median, the more pronounced the skewness of the lognormal distribution.
