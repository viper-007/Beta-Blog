The probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) are both concepts from probability theory and statistics. They describe different aspects of a random variable. The main differences are in what they represent and how they are interpreted.

# Probability Density Function (PDF)

**Description:** The PDF describes the probability of a random variable taking on a particular value. It is a non-negative function that integrates to 1 over its entire range.

**Representation:** The PDF, denoted as $f(x)$ for a random variable $X$, represents the probability distribution of the variable.

**Interpretation:** The area under the PDF curve over a range gives the probability that the random variable falls within that range.

**Integral Interpretation:** The integral of the PDF over a certain interval gives the probability that the random variable falls within that interval. Mathematically, for an interval $[a,b]$:

$$\large P(a≤X≤b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$

**Normalization:** The total area under the entire PDF curve is 1.

### Example

![](images/dice%20(3).jpg){width="75"}

Roll a perfect dice one time. Let $x$ denote the number that the dice lands on, then the probability density function for the outcome can be described as follows:

**P(x \< 1)** : 0

**P(x = 1)** : 1/6

**P(x = 2)** : 1/6

**P(x = 3)** : 1/6

**P(x = 4)** : 1/6

**P(x = 5)** : 1/6

**P(x = 6)** : 1/6

**P(x \> 6)** : 0

Note: This is an example of a discrete random variable, since $x$ can only take on integer values. For a continuous random variable, the PDF cannot be used, since the probability that $x$ takes on any exact value is zero.

# Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

**Description:** The CDF describes the probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a particular value. It is an increasing function that starts at 0 and approaches 1 as the value of x approaches the upper bound of the PDF. The value of the CDF at a particular point represents the probability that the random variable will take on a value less than or equal to that point.

**Representation:** The CDF, denoted as $F(x)$, represents the cumulative probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a specific value $x$.

**Interpretation:** $F(x)$ gives the probability that $X$ is less than or equal to $x$. The value $F(x)$ at a point $x$ is a cumulative probability.

**Integral Interpretation:** The CDF is related to the PDF through integration. Specifically, $F(x)$ is the integral of the PDF from $−∞$ to $x$:

$$\large F(x) = \int_{-∞}^{x} f(t) dt$$

**Range:** The CDF ranges from 0 to 1, with $F(−∞)=0$ and $F(∞)=1$.

**Monotonicity:** The CDF is a non-decreasing function.

### Example:

![](images/dice%20(3).jpg){width="75"}

Roll a perfect dice one time. Let $x$ denote the number that the dice lands on, then the cumulative distribution function for the outcome can be described as follows:

**P(x ≤ 0)** : 0

**P(x ≤ 1)** : 1/6

**P(x ≤ 2)** : 2/6

**P(x ≤ 3)** : 3/6

**P(x ≤ 4)** : 4/6

**P(x ≤ 5)** : 5/6

**P(x ≤ 6)** : 6/6

**P(x \> 6)** : 0

Note: The probability that $x$ is less than or equal to 6 is 6/6, which is equal to 1. This is because the dice will land on either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 with 100% probability. This example uses a discrete random variable, but a continuous density function can also be used for a continuous random variable.
