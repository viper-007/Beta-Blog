# Risk reporting

...

## Expected value

**Q:** Is the expected value a useful, appropriate measurement for quantitative risk management?

**A:** Yes, the expected value is a commonly used measurement in quantitative risk management. The expected value provides a single "numerical summary" of a probability distribution. However, it is important to note that relying solely on the expected value may have limitations. The probability of the expected value, the confidence interval, and a good understanding of the underlying probability distribution help to better understand the risk profile and make more comprehensive risk management decisions.

# Risk aggregation

There are a several methods to aggregate methods:

1.  **Opinion pooling:** Calculates the weighted average of the individual distributions with linear pooling or logarithmic pooling.

2.  **Monte Carlo simulation:** Generate a large number of random samples from each triangular distribution and combining them to obtain an aggregated result.

3.  **Convolution:** Combines probability density functions (PDF) of individual distributions to obtain a distribution representing the sum of them.

4.  **Bayesian inference:** Bayesian inference can be used when the distributions have different levels of uncertainty.

| Opinion pooling        | Calculates the average of teach triangular distribution.                                                         | Simple and straightforward                                  | May not be accurate if distributions have different shapes            |
| Monte Carlo simulation | Simulates random samples from each triangular distribution and combines them to form an aggregated distribution. | Simple method, but requires computer power                  | Computationally intensive                                             |
| Convolution            | Mathematical operation on two functions ($f$ and $g$) that produces a third function ($f*g$).                    | Complex method which requires higher mathematical knowledge | Computational complexity, sensitivity to assumptions                  |
| Bayesian inference     | Combine the information from multiple triangular distributions into a single posterior distribution.             | Flexibility, can handle small sample sizes                  | In many cases, analytical solutions for Bayesian models may not exist |
