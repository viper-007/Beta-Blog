## Standard deviation

-   Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion within a single dataset.

-   It is used to describe how individual data points deviate from the mean (average) of the dataset.

-   Standard deviation is typically used when you have the entire population data or when you want to analyze the variability within a single sample.

The formula for the **population standard deviation** (denoted as $σ$) is:

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}}$$

where:

-   $x_i$ represents each individual data point in the dataset

-   $\bar{x}$ is the mean (average) of all data points

-   $n$ is the number of data points in the dataset (sample size)

The formula for the **sample standard deviation** (denoted as $s$) is:

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

where:

-   $x_i$ represents each individual data point in the dataset

-   $\bar{x}$ is the mean (average) of all data points

-   $n$ is the number of data points in the dataset (sample size)

The standard deviation is a statistics tool in statistics that allows to understand the spread or dispersion of data points, the consistency of the data, and the degree of uncertainty associated with the data.

A smaller standard deviation indicates that data points tend to be closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation suggests more significant variability or spread within the dataset.

### R code

```{r}
# Data set
data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)

# Calculate sample standard deviation
sample_standard_deviation <- sd(data)

# Print the result
cat("Sample standard deviation:", sample_standard_deviation)
```

::: callout-note
The R function sd calculates the **sample** standard deviation.

## Standard error

-   Standard error measures the variability of a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) from one sample to another, assuming that multiple samples are drawn from the same population.

-   It provides an indication of the precision or accuracy of the sample statistic in estimating the population parameter.

-   Standard error is typically used in inferential statistics to make inferences about the population based on a sample.

The formula for the standard error (denoted as $SE$ is:

$$SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where:

-   $σ$ represents the population standard deviation

-   $n$ is the sample size

If the population standard deviation ($σ$) is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample, the formula becomes:

$$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where:

-   $s$ is the sample standard deviation

The standard error is used in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and other statistical analyses.

A smaller standard error indicates that the sample statistic is more precise and likely to be closer to the true population parameter. Conversely, a larger standard error suggests that the sample statistic has more uncertainty and could vary widely in different samples.

## Confidence interval

A confidence interval is a statistical range that is constructed around a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, to estimate the likely range of values of the corresponding population parameter. It provides a measure of uncertainty about the true value of the population parameter based on the information available from a sample.

-   A confidence interval is a range of values around a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) to estimate the likely range of values of the corresponding population parameter.
-   It provides a measure of the uncertainty about the true value the population parameter.
-   The confidence level is typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95% confidence interval), and it represents the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter in repeated sampling.

The formula for the confidence interval (denoted as $CI$) is:

$$CI = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where:

-   $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean

-   $z$ is the confidence level value

-   $s$ is the sample standard deviation

-   $n$ is the sample size (number of data points in the dataset)

Confidence intervals are used in statistical inference as they provide a range of plausible values for the population parameter and help in making more informed decisions and drawing conclusions from sample data.

The wider the confidence interval, the less precise the estimate, while a narrower confidence interval indicates a more precise estimate.

::: callout-note
-   The standard deviation quantifies the variation within a single dataset, while standard error quantifies the variability of a sample statistic across different samples from the same population.

-   The standard deviation describes the spread of the data points, while standard error describes the precision of a sample statistic in estimating the population parameter.

-   The standard error is a measure of precision or accuracy of the sample estimate, while a confidence interval is a range of values that provides an estimate of the likely range of the population parameter with a specified level of confidence.

-   The standard error helps in understanding the variability of the sample statistic, while confidence intervals help in making inferences about the population parameter based on the sample data.
