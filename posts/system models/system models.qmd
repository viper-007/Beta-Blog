System models can be classified in relation to their randomness (deterministic or stochastic), time-dependence (static or dynamic), and number types (continuous or discrete).

## Deterministic models

**Deterministic models** are based on the assumption that the future can be predicted with certainty, and they use a fixed set of inputs to produce a single, deterministic output. These models are often simpler and easier to understand than stochastic models, and they can be useful in situations where the input data is well-defined and reliable. However, deterministic models may not capture the full range of potential outcomes and can be overly optimistic about risk. Therefore, deterministic models are suitable for operational risk management.

## Stochastic models

**Stochastic models** incorporate randomness and uncertainty into their calculations, allowing them to generate a range of possible outcomes and associated probabilities. This can be particularly useful in situations where the input data is incomplete or subject to fluctuations over time. Stochastic models are more complex than deterministic models, but they are often better suited to capturing the full range of potential risks and their likelihoods. They are also more adaptable to changing circumstances and can provide more robust risk assessments.

## Static models

**Static models** are typically used to represent operational risks that do not change significantly over time, such as risks associated with a particular process, product, or service. For example, a static model could be used to identify and assess the operational risks associated with a specific product line or business unit. Static models can be useful for providing a high-level overview of operational risks and identifying areas for improvement.

## Dynamic models

**Dynamic models** take into account the changing nature of operational risks over time, allowing for the modeling of complex interactions and feedback loops. These models can be useful in situations where the risk environment is constantly evolving or where there are multiple sources of risk that can interact with one another.

## Discrete models

**Discrete models** use variables that change only at discrete set of points in time. Most operational risks are based on scenarios with a continuous range of values. However, discrete models can be used to analyze a specific events or scenarios that may lead to operational failures or losses. For example, a discrete model could be used to identify the specific events that could lead to a cyber attack or a supply chain disruption

## Continuous models

**Continuous models** are designed to model risks that occur over a continuous range of values, such as financial losses or process failures. These models can be useful for capturing the full distribution of possible outcomes and assessing the potential impact of different levels of risk exposure.

## Models for operational risks

**Stochastic, dynamic, continuous models** are suitable for operational risk management because they are designed to capture the inherent complexity and variability of operational risks.

Deterministic, static. discrete models are not appropriate for operational risk management because operational risks change over time (they are dynamic, not static) and operational risk parameters have continuous values.
